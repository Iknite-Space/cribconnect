  - `/boilerplate-components` - Templates in this directory are intended to be modified before being used in another projects.
* - `/core-components` - This directory contains templates that can be used directly in other projects.
* `custom-resource-lambdas` - This directory contains packaged lambda code for custom cloudformation resources.
* `/examples` - This directory contains examples of how these templates can be combined into a larger application.


Many templates in this repo were inspired by https://github.com/cloudsoft/cloudonaut-aws-cf-templates.
